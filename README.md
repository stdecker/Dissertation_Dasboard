# Dissertation Dashboard

This is the work of my dissertation project, titled *Mechanisms of Cigarette Smoke-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Striated Muscle and Aorta*. This work investigated the mechanisms by which cigarette smoke directly impairs mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle.

For an in-depth look at my data and links to the manuscripts, feel free to visit the GitHub page at [https://stdecker.github.io/Dissertation_Dasboard/](https://stdecker.github.io/Dissertation_Dashboard/).*

Please contact me for any changes or discrepancies. I will certainly be the first to admit that my R code for the analysis isn't clean in any sense of the term. This is mostly because I wrote the code as I went along with my analysis/plotting, and the plotting changed several times (the analysis didn't change much other than me finding simpler ways of performing the same analysis).

**Note: Aims 2 and 3 are switched from my dashboard and my dissertation document & R files. This is purely for asthetic purposes. Aim 2 in the document and R files refers to the substrate sensitiity work, while Aim 3 in these files refers to the mechanistic work with carboxyatractyloside. In the dashboard, these aims are switched.*
